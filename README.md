# tower-of-hanoi-visualized
This is an animation of the Tower of Hanoi game solution. The solution itself is computed with the recursive algorithm while all the graphics is handled using pygame.
Just change the n_disks variable in main.py for the number of disks you want in the Tower and run the file.
